Dear Colleagues:\\[1ex]

This letter accompanies our submission of a manuscript for your consideration. The manuscript ``A Latent Factor Approach to Measuring State Preferences'' develops a network based latent variable approach to measuring state preferences. We believe that this is a flexible framework that can be used to estimate unobservable concepts for a variety of phenomena political scientists are interested in studying.  \\[1ex]

In this paper, we focus on state preferences and provide a comparison of our approach to two prominent extant measures: S-scores and UN ideal point measures. We show that that our latent factor approach has better face validity than incumbent measures and that its expected effect in a regression on the initiation of militarized interstate disputes aligns with what scholars would expect. Most importantly, we show that by using our measure we can generate substantially more accurate out -of-sample prediction of MIDs than measures currently used in the literature. \\[1ex]

We look forward to your evaluation of this paper.\\[1ex]

Respectfully submitted,
