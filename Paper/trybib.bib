ACLED codes the actions of rebels, governments, and militias within unstable states, specifying the exact location and date of battle events, transfers of military control, headquarter establishment, civilian violence, and rioting. In the current version, the dataset covers 50 unstable countries from 1997 through 2010. ACLED's disaggregation of civil war and transnational violent events allow for research on local level factors and the dynamics of civil and communal conflict. Findings from subnational conflict research challenges conclusions from larger national-level studies. In a brief descriptive analysis, the authors find that, on average, conflict covers 15% of a state's territory, but almost half of a state can be directly affected by internal wars.},

The econometric  analysis, which is based on a modified version of ELES, recognizes  total spending as well as total income as endogenous variables. Identification  of the price effects is achieved by utilizing data on environmental  cost factors and local tastes. The performance of the estimated model  is investigated by testing its ability to make out-of-sample predictions  of local government behavior.},

In Democratic races where a sitting vice president does not run for  president, exhibition season predictions are murky and the cost of  trading timeliness for accuracy is higher.},

	abstract = {We offer a model of multiparty elections that combines voters' retrospective  economic evaluations with consideration of parties' issue positions  and the issue preferences of voters. We show that both policy issues  and the state of the economy matter in British elections. In 1987  voters made a largely retrospective evaluation of the Conservatives  based on economic performance; those who rejected the Conservative  Party chose between Labour and Alliance based on issue positions.  Through simulations we move the parties in the issue space and reestimate  vote shares as well as hypothesize an alternative distribution of  views on the economy, and we show that Labour had virtually no chance  to win with a centrist party as a viable alternative. The predictions  from our 1987 simulations are supported in an analysis of the 1992  British election. We argue for multinomial probit in studying three-party  elections because it allows for a richer formulation of politics  than do competing methods.},

Initial movement toward this goal has occurred in the development  and testing of a first-stage prototype crisis warning system. Tests  indicate that the prototype would have contributed to predictions  of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the Indo-Pakistani war,  and would enable analysts to track crisis and noncrisis events and  conditions and to interact productively with a computer-based system.  The second-stage prototype will continue to integrate, test, modify,  and apply existing and ongoing research to the overall warning and  management problem.},

Their simulation results show that the relationship between trade and war is ``highly conditioned on third factors, such as unit-level revisionism and the initial economic geography of the system''. They recommend that future scholars consider the 'closeness' in economic geography of noncontiguous states that are part of the same trading networks and economic blocs. They furthermore argue that technological innovations that facilitate trade may bring noncontiguous states closer in terms of interaction that is relevant to conflict and peace.},

Precise images and  measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships  that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The  study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the  observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution  of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by  longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article  identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural  features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease  transmission dynamics and social policy are explored. },

	abstract = {We address a well-known but infrequently discussed problem in the  quantitative study of international conflict: Despite immense data  collections, prestigious journals, and sophisticated analyses, empirical  findings in the literature on international conflict are often unsatisfying.  Many statistical results change from article to article and specification  to specification. Accurate forecasts are nonexistent. In this article  we offer a conjecture about one source of this problem: The causes  of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small  or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but  they are large, stable, and replicable wherever the ex ante probability  of conflict is large. This simple idea has an unexpectedly rich array  of observable implications, all consistent with the literature. We  directly test our conjecture by formulating a statistical model that  includes its critical features. Our approach, a version of a "neural  network" model, uncovers some interesting structural features of  international conflict and, as one evaluative measure, forecasts  substantially better than any previous effort. Moreover, this improvement  comes at little cost, and it is easy to evaluate whether the model  is a statistical improvement over the simpler models commonly used.},

@Article{bennett:1999,
	abstract = {Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (1997) provide a good overview of the  class of models known as "event history" or "duration" models, but  omit some important points about the relationship between duration  dependence and time-varying data in parametric models of duration.  The key reason to use duration analysis methods is to allow for the  possibility of duration dependence in one's data. However, while  assumptions about the form of duration dependence appear to be purely  methodological, duration dependence can have important substantive  implications for theories of politics. There is often an interaction  in estimation between duration dependence and covariates. In particular,  duration dependence can be revealed or eliminated when particular  time-varying variables are included in or removed from a model. This  point is especially important because time-varying covariates are  more central and common to important research questions than is sometimes  realized. Overall, these points lead to the conclusion that findings  about duration dependence go hand-in-hand with proper specification  and that model specification both in terms of functional form and  included variables must be carefully considered before duration methods  are applied.},

We conduct a series of Monte Carlo  analyses that estimate common duration models as well as our proposed  duration model with selection. These simulations show that ignoring  sample selection issues can lead to biased parameter estimates, including  the appearance of (nonexistent) duration dependence. In addition,  our proposed estimator is found to be superior in root mean-square  error terms when nontrivial amounts of selection are present. Finally,  we provide an empirical application of our method by studying whether  self-selectivity is a problem for studies of leaders' survival during  and following militarized conflicts.},

We present a class of duration models  for analyzing repeated events, discuss their properties and implementation,  and offer recommendations for their use by applied researchers.

Estimation of proportional hazards models when  hazards are non-proportional results in coefficient biases and decreased  power of significance tests. Techniques for relaxing this assumption  allow scholars to test whether the effects of covariates change over  time and also permit a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon  being studied. We address the potential problems with incorrectly  assuming proportionality, illustrate a number of tests for non-proportionality,  and conclude with a discussion of how to accurately and efficiently  estimate these models in the presence of nonproportional hazards.  We investigate the proportionality assumption for Cox's semiparametric  model in the context of the "liberal peace" debate, using data on  international conflict in the postwar period.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT Systemic theories of international politics rarely predict  conflict short of cataclysmic systemic wars, and dyadic theories  of conflict lack systemic perspective. This article attempts to bridge  the gap by introducing a two-step theory of conflict among Great  Powers. In the first stage, states engage in a dynamic, ongoing process  of managing the international system, which inevitably produces tensions  among them. In the second stage, relative levels of security-related  activity determine how and when those tensions erupt into disputes.  A test of the theory on Great Power conflicts from the nineteenth  century supports the argument and, moreover, favors the deterrence  model over the spiral model as a proximate explanation of conflict  in the second stage. },

	abstract = {The authors draw on Klinenberg's (2002) ethnography and recent neighborhood  theory to explain community-level variation in mortality during the  July 1995 Chicago heat wave. They examine the impact of neighborhood  structural disadvantage on heat wave mortality and consider three  possible intervening mechanisms: social network interaction, collective  efficacy, and commercial conditions. Combining Census and mortality  data with the 1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods  Community Survey and Systematic Social Observation, the authors estimate  hierarchical Poisson models of death rates both during the 1995 heat  wave and comparable, temporally proximate July weeks (1990-94, 1996).  They find that neighborhood affluence was negatively associated with  heat wave mortality. Consistent with Klinenberg's ethnographic study  of the Chicago heat wave, commercial decline was positively associated  with heat wave mortality and explains the affluence effect. Where  commercial decline was low, neighborhoods were largely protected  from heat-related mortality. Although social network interaction  and collective efficacy did not influence heat wave mortality, collective  efficacy was negatively associated with mortality during comparable  July weeks (when no heat wave occurred). Unequal distribution of  community-based resources had important implications for geographic  differences in survival rates during the Chicago heat wave, and may  be relevant for other disasters.},

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between  groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with  alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural  holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen,  which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital.  I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the  networks around managers in a large American electronics company.  The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has  its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations,  promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of  people whose networks span structural holes. The between-group brokers  are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed,  and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with  implications for creativity and structural change. },

	abstract = {This research examines an equation developed to forecast the two-party  presidential vote in the states. The equation is composed of 16 independent  variables measured at the national, regional, and state levels. It  includes national trial-heat polls from early in the campaign, the  growth in the national economy, presidential incumbency, the state's  voting record in the previous two presidential elections, home state  and regional advantages for the candidates, the partisan division  of the state legislature following the last midterm election, an  index of state ideology based on the roll call voting of its House  delegation, and five regional trend variables to take into account  partisan shifts over time. The equation is estimated over 531 state  elections from 1948 to 1988. The overall fit of the equation is quite  good. It accounts for nearly 85% of the variance, leaves a standard  error of less than four percentage points, and has an average error  of just three percentage points of the vote. This level of accuracy  is comparable to that of Steven Rosenstone's equation in his Forecasting  Presidential Elections (1983). Moreover, the equation is quite parsimonious  and yields forecasts by early September of the election year.},

	abstract = {Gamson's Law-the proposition that coalition governments will distribute  portfolios in proportion to each member party's contribution of seats  to the coalition-has been one of the most prominent landmarks in  coalitional studies since the 1970s. However, standard bargaining  models of government formation argue that Gamson's Law should not  hold, once one controls for relevant indicators of bargaining power.  In this article, we extend these bargaining models by allowing parties  to form pre-election pacts. We argue that campaign investments by  pact signatories depend on how they anticipate portfolios will be  distributed and, thus, signatories have an incentive to precommit  to portfolio allocation rules. We show that pacts will sometimes  agree to allocate portfolios partly or wholly in proportion to members'  contributions of seats to the coalition; this increases each signatory's  investment in the campaign, thereby conferring external benefits  (in the form of a larger probability of an alliance majority) on  other coalition members. Empirical tests support the model's predictions.  We thank the NSF for support under grant SES-0518192. We thank the  participants in NYU's law and politics seminar (October 2004) and  the University of Chicago's political economy seminar (February 2005).  We also thank James Druckman, Orit Kedar, Michael Laver, Massimo  Morelli, and Paul Warwick, as well as the anonymous reviewers, for  their comments. Finally, we thank Paul Warwick and James Druckman  for their data on portfolio allocations in Western Europe.},

	abstract = {Computational modeling is used to improve our understanding of how  the democratic peace unfolds as a historical process in time and  space. Whereas most of the conventional literature interprets the  phenomenon as a constant and universal law operating at the state  level, the author follows Immanuel Kant and treats democratic cooperation  as an emergent macroprocess. The current study explores three causal  mechanisms. First, strategic tagging introduces a way for democracies  to select out like-minded cooperators. Second, regime-sensitive alliances  enable democratic states to defend the gains of cooperation. Third,  liberal collective security complements the liberal alignments. Based  on these processes, it is possible to "grow" cooperative outcomes  in an inhospitable geopolitical environment. Because tagging alone  is insufficient, alliances, and sometimes even collective security,  are necessary to produce perpetual peace. Such outcomes are characterized  by high levels of spatial clustering.},

	abstract = {We report an attempt to use financial market data to predict the onset  of a variety of international crises. A quasi-experimental design  for studying interrupted time series data is applied to the historical  behavior of the Hong Kong and New York financial markets. The results  are generally disappointing. These markets seem more likely to react  to rather than anticipate crisis developments, and frequently issue  "false alarms." Comparison of results for periods where crises took  place with those for randomly selected periods where no crisis happened  does not engender confidence in markets as crisis predictors. However,  there are some notable exceptions to this pessimistic generalization.  We conclude that financial indicators may be profitably used in some  cases to supplement warning assessments derived from other methods  and sources.},

	abstract = {In recent years, constructivist thinking about global politics has  brought a breath of fresh air to international relations. By exploring  questions of identity and interest, constructivist scholars have  articulated an important corrective to the methodological individualism  and materialism that have come to dominate much of ir. As the books  under review indicate, constructivism has also succeeded in demonstrating  its empirical value--documenting a new and important causal role  for norms and social structure in global politics. Theoretically,  however, the approach remains underspecified. In particular, constructivists  typically fail to explain the origins of such structures, how they  change over time, how their effects vary cross nationally, or the  mechanisms through which they constitute states and individuals.  Missing is the substantive theory and attention to agency that will  provide answers to such puzzles, as well as ensure the development  of a productive research program.},

	abstract = {In Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant presents six preliminary articles  for perpetual peace beforethe three well-known definitive articles  about republic constitutions, commercial relations, and international  organizations. In his third preliminary article, Kant argues that  "Standing Armies (miles perpetuus) Shall in Time be Totally Abolished"  because they are themselves "a cause of offensive war." Empirical  results based on state-of-the-art data analysis that refers to both  peace-years correction and distributed-lags logistic regression showthat  the most obvious among the neglected preliminary articles by Kant--military  manpower system--is indeed connected to involvement in militarized  interstate disputes during the period from 1886 to 1992. For neo-Kantian  peace theory and research, this means that a military manpower system  with conscripted, notstanding (i.e., professional or voluntary),  soldiers is associated with disputes.},

This article  argues that foreign states behave strategically in order to (a) avoid  becoming the targets of domestically troubled executives or (b) to  take advantage of the domestic trouble another state endures. Such  "strategic interaction" delimits the set of foreign policies reasonably  available to leaders in trouble at home, thus producing the impetus  for policy substitution. This article develops a theoretical model  of strategic behavior and policy substitution and reports empirical  results of a multivariate probit model.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT In this article I investigate the apparent tension between  liberal theories that highlight the foreign policy benefits of domestic  accountability and the observation that the public tends to reflexively  support a leader during an international crisis. Previous theories  of the process by which the public rallies around their leader tend  to highlight the emotional and automatic nature of citizens&apos;  responses to threats. Using a simple signaling model, I show that  the political and operational circumstances that increase the probability  of post hoc verification and punishment for privately motivated policy  enhance the credibility of a leader&apos;s choices and transmit information  on the benefits of action to the public. I derive several observable  hypotheses from the informational model, linking the costliness of  the signal, the presences of divided government, election years,  active term limits, political insecurity, changes in freedom of information  laws, and trust in government to the size of the rally in the United  States. A battery of empirical tests offer strong support for the  informational model and suggest that a public rally is a rational  response to numerous international crisis circumstances. Observing  a rally need not imply an emotional or irrational public.The author  would like to thank Eric Chang, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Henk Goemans,  Burt Monroe, Joachim Rennstich, Ken Bickers, Steve Chan, Tom Hammond,  and Brian Silver for comments and constructive criticism. Three reviewers  and the editorial staff at IO also deserve considerable thanks for  contributing to the coherence of the article. As always, the remaining  faults solely reflect the faults of the author. },

	abstract = {For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption that old age  is characterized by social isolation. However, there has been no  systematic, nationally representative evaluation of this possibility  in terms of social network connectedness. In this article, we develop  a profile of older adults' social integration with respect to nine  dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary associations.  We use new data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging  Project (NSHAP), a population-based study of non-institutionalized  older Americans ages 57 to 85, conducted in 2005 to 2006. Results  suggest that among older adults, age is negatively related to network  size, closeness to network members, and number of non-primary-group  ties. On the other hand, age is positively related to frequency of  socializing with neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering.  In addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of contact  with network members. These findings are inconsistent with the view  that old age has a universal negative influence on social connectedness.  Instead, life-course factors have divergent consequences for different  forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later life transitions,  such as retirement and bereavement, may prompt greater connectedness.  We conclude by urging increased dialogue between social gerontological  and social network research.},

Yet, that research has yet to make an impact  on presidential elections forecasting, where models are estimated  with fewer than 25 elections, and often no more than 15. In this  research note, we apply equal weights to generate out-of-sample and  one-step-ahead predictions in two sets of related presidential elections  models, Fair's presidential equation and the fiscal model. We find  that most of the time, using equal weights coefficients does improve  the forecasting performance of both.},

Statistical analysis shows that friendship between  countries is largely determined by geographical proximity, with a  visible five-bloc structure. However, large immigrant groups often  swayed national ties by voting for their home country. Some countries,  such as Switzerland, appear to play a significant bridging role,  and the Eastern Mediterranean bloc appears to act as a bridge to  the new Balkan countries. Analysis thus reveals an emerging Europe  very different from previous network studies of this kind. The analysis  techniques demonstrated here have more general applicability, and  may be useful for analysing other types of friendship networks.},

	abstract = {Empirical studies on trade and conflict generally make use of highly  aggregated data. There are, however, good theoretical arguments to  suspect that trade in some goods should have a bigger impact on the  likelihood of conflict than trade in others. This article examines  the relationship between trade and conflict at a lower level of aggregation.  It discusses various theoretical arguments why the relationship between  trade and conflict should vary across industry sectors, particularly  strategic trade, asset specificity, and possible appropriation of  gains from trade. The central hypotheses are tested using dyadic  United Nations trade data disaggregated at industry level from 1970  to 1997. The main findings are that trade generally reduces the likelihood  of conflict, the relationship is weaker for commodities that are  more easily appropriable by force, and the relationship is generally  stronger for manufactured goods with the notable exceptions of chemical  and metal industries and the high-technology sector.},

	abstract = {International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that a civil  war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed  to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts  can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility,  the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of  international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One  can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose  area is the "political space"-or effective capacity-for building  peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124  post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations  peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively  correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral  enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence.  Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate  peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities,  and international capacities.},

	abstract = {Using time-series procedures, the authors investigate whether transnational  terrorism changed following 9/11 and the subsequent U.S.-led "war  on terror." Perhaps surprising, little has changed in the time series  of overall incidents and most of its component series. When 9/11  is prejudged as a break date, the authors find that logistically  complex hostage-taking events have fallen as a proportion of all  events, while logistically simple, but deadly, bombings have increased  as a proportion of deadly incidents. These results hold when they  apply the Bai-Perron procedure in which structural breaks are data  identified. This procedure locates earlier breaks in the mid-1970s  and 1990s. Reasonable out-of-sample forecasts are possible if structural  breaks are incorporated fairly rapidly into the model.},

	abstract = {What explains variation in domestic political instability in polities  imposed by foreign powers? We formulate a framework grounded in four  sources of political instability in imposed polities: (1) the initial  conditions under which a polity is imposed, (2) policy choices made  by the imposer, (3) the prevailing domestic conditions within states  hosting the imposed polity, and (4) the international environment  within which the host state is embedded. Employing a sample of ninety-four  imposed polities during the period 1816---1994 to test expectations  from the framework, we find, in part, that ethnoreligious heterogeneity  coupled with democratic institutions, preimposition military defeat,  colonial experience, dissimilarity of neighboring political institutions,  hostility from neighboring states, and the presence of the imposing  state each stimulate political instability. The analysis suggests  a bleak prognosis for domestic peace in postinvasion Afghanistan  and Iraq as the causal factors that militate against domestic stability  are manifold and likely reinforcing.},

	abstract = {he October 2008 issue of PS published a symposium of presidential  and congressional forecasts made in the summer leading up to the  election. This article is an assessment of the accuracy of their  models.    Prior to the 2008 presidential election we provided forecasts of the  final vote relying on a model containing only two variables: (1)  the cumulated weighted growth in leading economic indicators (LEI)  through the thirteenth quarter of the sitting president's term; and  (2) the incumbent party candidate's share in the most recent trial-heat  polls. The novelty is the reliance on the advanced reading of the  economy from the quarter ending in March of the election year. (The  exact equation and the exact forecast change as the poll readings  get closer to the election.) Our final forecast (Erikson and Wlezien  2008) based on trial-heat polls in August was that Barack Obama would  win 52.2% of the two-party popular vote. This turned out to be quite  close to the Election Day outcome of 53.5% (as of December 2), a  little more than one percentage point above what we predicted.},

This paper  challenges that optimistic assessment of election markets, based  on an analysis of Iowa Electronic Market (IEM) data from presidential  elections between 1988 and 2004. We argue that it is inappropriate  to naively compare market forecasts of an election outcome with exact  poll results on the day prices are recorded, that is, market prices  reflect forecasts of what will happen on Election Day whereas trial-heat  polls register preferences on the day of the poll. We then show that  when poll leads are properly discounted, poll-based forecasts outperform  vote-share market prices. Moreover, we show that win projections  based on the polls dominate prices from winner-take-all markets.  Traders in these markets generally see more uncertainty ahead in  the campaign than the polling numbers warrant---in effect, they overestimate  the role of election campaigns. Reasons for the performance of the  IEM election markets are considered in concluding sections.},

Against this view, I show that under very broad  conditions there will exist negotiated settlements that genuinely  rational states would mutually prefer to a risky and costly fight.  Popular rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either  to address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders from  locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two mechanisms can  resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist terms. The first turns  on the fact that states have both private information about capabilities  and resolve and the incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns  on the fact that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable  credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain. Historical  examples suggest that both mechanisms are empirically plausible.},

Analysis of  a game-theoretic model of crisis signaling substantially refines  and revises this claim. Due to selection effects arising from strategic  behavior, measures of the relative strength of a defender's interests  that are available before a crisis begins (ex ante) should be related  to the failure of the defender's threats during the crisis. Ex ante  measures of the defender's relative military strength should correlate  with the success of the defender's crisis threats, but due to strategic  dynamics that are not grasped by the standard arguments. A reanalysis  of Huth and Russett's data on immediate deterrent threats lends support  for these and other hypotheses drawn from the game-theoretic treatment.},

	abstract = {An influential conventional wisdom holds that civil wars proliferated  rapidly with the end of the Cold War and that the root cause of many  or most of these has been ethnic and religious antagonisms. We show  that the current prevalence of internal war is mainly the result  of a steady accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s  and 1960s rather than a sudden change associated with a new, post-Cold  War international system. We also find that after controlling for  per capita income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries  have been no more likely to experience significant civil violence  in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period  in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form  of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse political agendas.  The factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil  war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather  the conditions that favor insurgency. These include poverty-which  marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors  rebel recruitment-political instability, rough terrain, and large  populations.},

	abstract = {It is common for scholars interested in race and poverty to invoke  a lack of access to job networks as one of the reasons that African  Americans and Hispanics face difficulties in the labor market. Much  research has found, however, that minorities do worse when they use  personal networks in job finding. Research in this area has been  hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the job-finding  process and by the lack of appropriate comparison data for demonstrating  the various ways in which minorities can be isolated from good job  opportunities. We seek to specify what it means to say that minorities  are cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on social  networks in the labor market, we delineate the various mechanisms  by which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities.  We examine how these mechanisms operate, using unique data on the  chain of network contacts that funnel to an employer offering desirable  jobs. We find that network factors operate at several stages of the  recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that these  network factors serve to cut off minorities from employment in this  setting. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological  implications of the case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.},

Much theorizing  about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards  of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent  empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role  in creating political change, but change processes have been less  well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical  arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political  change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage "life cycle"  of emergence, "norm cascades," and internalization, and that each  stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral  logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many  social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress  will only be made by placing attention on the connections between  norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},

	abstract = {Poole and Rosenthal (1997) argue that most congressional voting can  be understood in terms of a low-dimensional spatial model. This paper  uses their model to assess the importance of the two mechanisms that  could contribute to the vote-predicting power of constituency variables:  (i) constituency variables may predict where legislators fall along  one or two dimensions in the vote-predicting spatial model and (ii)  constituency variables may account for errors in the spatial model's  predictions. The paper compares different methods of using a basic  set of constituency variables to generate out-of-sample predictions  for representatives' votes. The analysis covers a large number of  recent House roll call votes, considering Democrats and Republicans  separately and using Poole and Rosenthal's W-NOMINATE scores to measure  legislators' locations in vote-predicting space. The results show  that the predictive power of a basic set of constituency variables  arises principally from its ability to predict representatives' locations  in Poole and Rosenthal's space, not from its ability to explain errors  in the predictions based on that space. This holds true to a remarkable  extent, consistent with Poole and Rosenthal's argument that the influence  of constituent interests occurs largely through logrolling mechanisms  reflected in their spatial model.},

We depart from  that strategy in several ways. We define interest groups at the level  of Standard Industrial Classification two-digit codes and observe  the universe of interests. For 1979-90, we use measures of geographically  and non-geographically based economic interests to estimate the representative's  party and ideology. We also consider the factor endowments of individuals  within a district to examine their impact on floor votes. We then  investigate the influence of these interests on members' party affiliation  and ideology, as well as a pool of five floor votes on foreign trade,  using instrumental variables for party and ideology. Economic interests  account for a substantial portion of the variance in all cases, and  models that also include other explanatory variables are highly accurate  in estimating floor votes.},

	abstract = {Contemporary analyses of international relations forecasting contain  conceptual and epistemological errors. Alternative definitions of  forecasting are contradictory; programs for developing scientific  forecasts of international phenomena fail to acknowledge important  epistemological difficulties. Forecasting and prediction are distinguished,  and several illustrations of each type of activity are presented.  Criteria for determining the soundness of scientific forecasts then  are offered, and the prospects for constructing sound international  relations forecasts are assessed. The primary conclusion is that  individual-level generalizations of events like crises have the greatest  potential in this regard. Forecasts of systems-transformation, in  contrast, will never be scientifically sound; generalizations of  this kind offer the least potential for developing scientifically  meaningful forecasts.},

	abstract = {Otherwise powerful, formidable democracies are tempting targets for  international violence because they have leaders who, on average,  have been in office for shorter periods of time than leaders of autocracies.  Domestic incentives may make resistance more costly than offering  concessions for inexperienced leaders of both democratic and authoritarian  states. Over time, however, resistance may become domestically less  costly, causing experienced leaders to be more likely to prefer resistance.  Anticipating this response, potential challengers may be more likely  to target inexperienced leaders. Because democracies generally have  high rates of leadership turnover, they are tempting targets for  international violence. Statistical analysis of crisis initiation  between 1918 and 1992 confirms the perception that democracies are  more likely to be targets of militarized challenges. Results are  also consistent with the proposition that the relatively short tenure  in office served by democratic leaders helps to account for the observed  pattern of democratic attraction of foreign challenges.},

Using unique retrospective data, the paper first assesses friendship  homophily over the four years of college. Friendship is homophilous  across gender and race. QAP regression is used to determine the impact  of both preference and propinquity (measured by participation in  joint extra-curricular activities and shared academic major) on friendship  choice. While preference predicts friendship choice in the freshman  year, propinquity remains the strongest determinant of friendship  choice over the four years.},

	abstract = {The authors take a new look at the relationship between regime type  and deadly militarized conflict among pairs of states (dyads) in  the international system. With the goal of describing the general  functional form, they evaluate three perspectives: democratic peace,  regime similarity and regime rationality. They employ both standard  logistic regression (logit) and a recently developed machine learning  technique, a support vector machine (SVM). Logit is dependent on  assumptions that limit flexibility and make it difficult to discern  the appropriate functional form. SVM estimation, on the other hand,  is highly flexible and appears capable of discovering a relationship  that is contingent on other variables in the model. SVM results indicate  that regime similarity and joint democracy are important in most  dyadic interactions. However, for the special but important case  of the most dangerous dyads, regime rationality plays a role and  the democratic peace effect is dominant. The results suggest that  models of international conflict excluding distinct indicators for  political similarity, joint democracy and joint autocracy may be  misspecified. SVMs are an especially useful complement to conventional  statistical methods.},

	abstract = {The international system is not only an expression of domestic structures,  but a cause of them. Two schools of analysis exploring the impact  of the international system upon domestic politics (regime types,  institutions, coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which  stress the international economy, and those which stress political-military  rivalry, or war. Among the former are such arguments as: late industrialization  (associated with Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments  (Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American writing in  the 50s and 60s); transnational relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane,  Morse); neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists (Schurmann).  Arguments stressing the role of war include those which focus on  the organizational requirements of providing security (Hintze, Anderson),  the special nature of foreign relations (classical political theory),  territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains of foreign  involvement (analysis of revolutions). These arguments provide the  basis for criticism of much of the literature which uses domestic  structure as an explanation of foreign policy, in particular those  which (such as the strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by  excessive focus on forms, to obscure the connection between structures  and interests, and the role of politics. These arguments also permit  criticism of the notion of a recent fundamental discontinuity in  the nature of international relations.},

The paper shows that the game-theoretic  notion of self-enforcing equilibrium and the historical institutionalist  focus on process are both inadequate to answer these questions. Building  on a game-theoretic foundation, but responding to the critique of  it by historical institutionalists, the paper introduces the concepts  of quasi-parameters and self reinforcement. With these concepts,  and building on repeated game theory, a dynamic approach to institutions  is offered, one that can account for endogenous change (and stability)  of institutions. Contextual accounts of formal governing institutions  in early modern Europe and the informal institution of cleavage structure  in the contemporary world provide illustrations of the approach.},

However, this essay's principal argument is that neoliberal institutionalism  misconstrues the realist analysis of international anarchy and therefore  it misunderstands realism's analysis of the inhibiting effects of  anarchy on the willingness of states to cooperate. This essay highlights  the profound divergences between realism and the newest liberal institutionalism.  It also argues that the former is likely to be proven analytically  superior to the latter.},

To do this, the authors control for the dyadic characteristics of trade, democracy, alliance, and a large host of additional variables (they use pooled cross-national time-series data on state dyad-years during the period from 1885 to 1992). They then show how clusters within social networks emerge from mutual IGO membership and confer varying degrees of social position or prestige (and thus power) on states, which in turn shapes the nature of conflicts between states. They demonstrate that states in larger structurally equivalent clusters are more prone to military disputes both with members and nonmembers, while pairs of states with high relative disparities in prestige will have less conflictual relations with each other (the greater the difference in prestige in a country dyad, the more likely the countries can settle conflicts before they become militarized).},

Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate  conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous measurement  of peer delinquency than previous research. Findings from this study  indicate that friends' delinquency is associated with an adolescent's  own delinquency involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents'  friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents' centrality  and popularity, condition the delinquency-peer association. Network  density, in particular, emerges as an important component of the  delinquency-peer association, with very cohesive networks containing  stronger delinquency-peer associations than those that are less cohesive.  These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the underlying  structural properties of friendship networks in order to understand  the impact of peer influence on adolescent delinquency. },

This measure is better suited to study this  question than existing measures since it is by definition uncorrelated  with asymmetries in country size. The relationship between the different  conceptions of interdependence and militarized conflict is explored  in an expected utility model of trade, distribution of resources,  and conflict. For the particular pacifying mechanisms of trade studied  here, the model supports the view that trade reduces the incentives  for conflict but that this effect is most clearly seen in relatively  symmetric dyads.},

The  article applies Zipf's notion of a ``gravity model'' to the risk  of interstate conflict and argues that the empirical relationship  between size and distance and conflict is stronger than any other  identified in dyadic statistical studies of interstate conflict.  Most empirical studies of interstate conflict fail to take size properly  into account. The article shows that controlling for size variables  improves the estimation of other variables of interest, and it explores  the impact of omitting size variables for the investigation of the  power preponderance versus power parity debate. The results indicate  that even though a power capability ratio variable suggests asymmetric  dyads are less conflict-prone, the risk-increasing effect of power  itself means that a unilateral increase of power in one country increases  the risk of conflict.},

	abstract = {Coherent democracies and harshly authoritarian states have few civil  wars, and intermediate regimes are the most conflict-prone. Domestic  violence also seems to be associated with political change, whether  toward greater democracy or greater autocracy. Is the greater violence  of intermediate regimes equivalent to the finding that states in  political transition experience more violence? If both level of democracy  and political change are relevant, to what extent is civil violence  related to each? Based on an analysis of the period 1816-1992, we  conclude that intermediate regimes are most prone to civil war, even  when they have had time to stabilize from a regime change. In the  long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable than autocracies,  which in turn are less stable than democracies, durable democracy  is the most probable end-point of the democratization process. The  democratic civil peace is not only more just than the autocratic  peace but also more stable.},

	abstract = {Domestic political conflict has been a constant companion to international  trade, but the nature of that conflict has varied greatly in Western  democracies over the last two centuries. Political battles over trade  policy appear to have sometimes divided societies along broad class  lines and at other times split them into narrow industry-based coalitions.  I argue that this diversity stems from historical and cross-national  variation in inter-industry factor mobility. Class coalitions are  more likely where factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based  coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence from six  Western economies for the last two centuries indicates that levels  of factor mobility have varied historically and cross-nationally  in accord with industrialization and regulation. This variation corresponds  broadly with observable differences in the formation of trade policy  coalitions.},

Higher  status contexts often encourage participation among higher status  individuals at the same time that they discourage participation among  lower status individuals. As a result, political activity is more  highly structured by individual status in higher status contexts  than in lower status contexts. The effect of the social context seems  most pronounced upon political activities which require social interaction,  and alternative explanations based upon individual attributes do  not satisfactorily account for the social context's effect.},

Our data base combines a 1984 election survey of citizens  in South Bend, Indiana with a subsequent survey of people with whom  these citizens discuss politics. Several findings emerge from the  effort. First, individuals do purposefully construct informational  networks corresponding to their own political preferences, and they  also selectively misperceive socially supplied political information.  More important, both of these individual-level processes are shown  to be conditioned by constraints imposed due to the distribution  of political preferences in the social context. Thus, individual  control over socially supplied political information is partial and  incomplete. Finally, these information-transmitting processes interact  with the social context in a manner that favors partisan majorities  while undermining political minorities.},

We outline a research design  for doing so, by studying the circumstances under which, in a set  of enduring rivalries, challengers are likely to initiate militarized  disputes. We indicate the conceptual and operational steps necessary  to make and empirically compare predictions stemming from three often-competing  theoretical frameworks: rational deterrence, a general model of rational  conflict initiation, and a cognitive psychological model of behavior  emphasizing risk orientation and misperception. The results of probit  analysis on a pooled time series of enduring rivalries since 1945  provide support for hypotheses from each of the different theoretical  models.},

Hypotheses on the political  and military conditions under which extended-immediate deterence  is likely to succeed or fail are formulated and tested by probit  analysis on fifty-eight historical cases. The empirical results indicate  that (1) the military capability of the defender to deny the potential  attacker a quick and decisive victory on the battlefield enhances  deterrence; (2) a policy of reciprocity in diplomacy and military  actions by the defender contributes strongly to deterrence success;  and (3) a past record of backing down under pressure or intransigence  in confrontations with the potential attacker increases the likelihood  of deterrence failure.},

These states are the most powerful ones in the world  and, so, are traditional rivals. Thus the change is striking and  consequential Constructivists explain this in terms of changed ideas  and identities; liberals point to democracy and economic interest;  realists stress the role of nuclear weapons and American hegemony.  My own explanation combines the high cost of war, the gains from  peace, and the values that are prevalent within the security community.  Whatever the cause, the existence of the community will bring with  it major changes in international politics and calls into question  many traditional theories of war.},

	abstract = {The authors analyze a unique data source to study the determinants  of violence against civilians in a civil war context. During the  Vietnam War, the United States Department of Defense pioneered the  use of quantitative analysis for operational purposes. The centerpiece  of that effort was the Hamlet Evaluation System (HES), a monthly  and quarterly rating of `the status of pacification at the hamlet  and village level throughout the Republic of Vietnam'. Consistent  with existing theoretical claims, the authors find that homicidal  violence against civilians was a function of the level of territorial  control exercised by the rival sides: Vietnamese insurgents relied  on selective violence primarily where they enjoyed predominant, but  not full, control; South Vietnamese government and US forces exercised  indiscriminate violence primarily in the most rebel-dominated areas.  Violence was less common in the most contested areas. The absence  of spatial overlap between insurgent selective and incumbent indiscriminate  violence, as well as the relative absence of violence from contested  areas, demonstrates both the fundamental divergence between irregular  and conventional war and the need for cautious use of violent events  as indicators of conflict.},

This  paper attempts to show that foreign economic policy can be understood  only if domestic factors are systematically included in the analysis.  The paper's first part groups the recent literature into three paradigms  which distinguish between three international effects. The second  part offers a comparison of the differences between a state-centered  policy network in France and a society-centered network in the United  States. The third part of the paper combines the arguments of the  first two and analyzes French and American commercial, financial,  and energy policies as the outcome of both international effects  and domestic structures. These case studies show that domestic factors  must be included in an analysis of foreign economic policies. The  paper's main results are analyzed further in its fourth part.},

	abstract = {This article offers the first independent scholarly evaluation of  the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences of the State Failure  Task Force and its efforts to forecast when states will fail. State  failure refers to the collapse of the authority of the central government  to impose order, as in civil wars, revolutionary wars, genocides,  politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions. States  that sponsor terrorism or allow it to be organized within their borders  are all failed states. This task force, set up at the behest of Vice  President Gore in 1994, has been led by a group of distinguished  academics working as consultants to the U.S. CIA. State Failure Task  Force reports and publications have received attention in the media,  in academia, and from public decision makers. The article identifies  several methodological errors in the task force work that cause its  reported forecast probabilities of conflict to be too large, its  causal inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and its  claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated. However, the  article also finds that the task force has amassed the best and most  carefully collected data on state failure to date, and the required  corrections provided in this article, although very large in effect,  are easy to implement. The article also demonstrates how to improve  forecasting performance to levels significantly greater than even  corrected versions of its models. Although the matter is still a  highly uncertain endeavor, the authors are nevertheless able to offer  the first accurate forecasts of state failure, along with procedures  and results that may be of practical use in informing foreign policy  decision making. The article also describes a number of strong empirical  regularities that may help in ascertaining the causes of state failure.},

	abstract = {We examine whether the conditions affecting initial expressions of  hostility are similar to those affecting militarized disputes. Analyzing  dyadic interactions during the years 1951-1992, we estimate a model  to take into account selection effects and check it against another  allowing conjunctive causation. Both provide close approximations  to theoretical models of the conflict process and yield similar results.  We confirm Kant's belief that all states are subject to the realist  conditions of interstate competition that makes disputes likely,  but that liberal influences, if present, can constrain the escalation  of such disputes to war. Several influences on the conflict process  have nonmonotonic effects over the range of state behavior. Geopolitical  factors affect the opportunity for conflict more at lower levels  of the conflict process, when less information is available regarding  acceptable settlements and actors' resolve, than at higher levels.  Factors affecting willingness gain importance as the conflict process  unfolds because they facilitate the flow of information relevant  to the ongoing dispute. The proposition that democracy and interdependence  encourage diplomatic conflicts as signals of resolve is not supported.},

Researchers  have concluded that either peer selection or peer influence explained  the similarity. This paper examines this research question differently  using complete network data and arrives at different conclusions.  Findings emonstrate that similarity in the substance use of teenagers  and their peers is explained by either peer selection or peer influence  for some, by both peer selection and peer influence for others, and  by neither for others. Using a sociological approach and a social  network perspective this paper demonstrates how chain reactions result  in similarity in the substance use of teenagers in their peer groups,  by drawing together those who are similar with those who are not.  The paper demonstrates how chain reactions involve peer selection,  the patterning of peer ties and peer influence, and explores how  gender affects all aspects of the chain reaction process.},

Given the uneven  distribution of casualties during a conflict, the costs of international  violence vary between constituencies and thus affect representatives  differently. The authors develop a constituency-based theory of legislator  accountability and legislature behavior that predicts when democracies  are willing to pay human costs in an interstate conflict and their  likelihood of being involved in a dispute. The results suggest that  the more diffuse political account-ability, the less likely a state  is to get involved in a militarized dispute, but that once involved,  the more likely a state will sustain casualties. The authors'theory  suggests that choices over the mechanisms of political representation  have far-reaching effects on political accountability and foreign  policy.},

We argue that international actors are goal-seeking agents who make  specific institutional design choices to solve the particular cooperation  problems they face in different issue-areas. In this article we introduce  the theoretical framework of the Rational Design project. We identify  five important features of institutions-membership, scope, centralization,  control, and flexibility-and explain their variation in terms of  four independent variables that characterize different cooperation  problems: distribution, number of actors, enforcement, and uncertainty.  We draw on rational choice theory to develop a series of empirically  falsifiable conjectures that explain this institutional variation.  The authors of the articles in this special issue of International  Organization evaluate the conjectures in specific issue-areas and  the overall Rational Design approach.},

	abstract = {A unique longitudinal and prospective approach is used to analyze  the social embeddedness of rural-urban Thai migrants and their subsequent  migration. More than any one particular social tie, it is the configuration  of social ties at multiple levels that influences whether migrants  experience their destination as integrative and a place for settlement  or not. Social ties at multiple levels and from multiple sources  weave into a social fabric that surrounds migrants in destination  contexts, shaping their migration trajectories. The findings show  that urban-integrated migrants with diverse social support ties in  the urban destination who reside in village enclaves and households  that promote social adaptation and incorporation tend to be found  again in urban destinations 6 years later. By comparison, semi-integrated  and urban-isolated migrants whose social support ties, community  structures, and households provide relatively weak links and support  within the urban setting exhibit stronger tendencies to return to  their villages of origin or to migrate onward from their initial  destination. The findings suggest that migrants' mobility pathways-whether  they settle in their current destination, return to their villages  of origin, or make additional movements onward-depend on the organization  of urban social relations and migrants' positions therein.},

	abstract = {The structure of international trade, identified by the degree of  openness for the movement of goods, can best be explained by a state-power  theory of international political economy. This theory begins with  the assumption that the nature of international economic movements  is determined by states acting to maximize national goals. Four goals--aggregate  national income, political power, social stability, and economic  growth--can be systematically related to the degree of openness in  the international trading system for states of different relative  sizes and levels of development. This analysis leads to the conclusion  that openness is most likely to exist when there is a hegemonic distribution  of potential economic power. Time-series data on tariff levels, trade  proportions, regional concentration, per capita income, national  income, share of world trade, and share of world investment are then  presented. The first three are used to describe the degree of openness  in the trading system; the last four, the distribution of state power.  The data suggest that the state-power theory should be amended to  take into consideration domestic political constraints on state action.},

	abstract = {Theory: It is argued here that previous studies analyzing the formation  of voters' economic expectations overlook important subtleties found  in a differentiated (heterogeneous) electorate. Since different segments  of the electorate possess varying information capabilities, it is  asserted that they will form their prospective economic evaluations  differently from one another. Hypotheses: The impact of "expectational"  electoral cycles, news coverage of the economy reported by voters,  retrospective economic evaluations, and personal financial expectations  are hypothesized to have a differential impact on their economic  expectations based on varying levels of information (education) among  subsets of the electorate. Methods: Time series multiple regression  analysis is conducted for the monthly period between January 1978  and December 1990. The empirical analysis involves testing for the  properties of the statistical time series (i.e., integration and  cointegration) as well as specification of an error correction mechanism  (ECM) that captures long-run statistical relationships in appropriate  circumstances. Results: These findings uncover electoral heterogeneity  (based on information/education differences) with respect to voters'  prospective economic evaluations. Specifically, the information capabilities  of voters is inversely related to their reliance on past/retrospective  sources of information when forming both egocentric and sociotropic  economic expectations. The main implication of this research is that  the assumption of electoral homogeneity contained in previous longitudinal  analyses of aggregate economic opinion formation provides misleading  results that either overlook intra-electoral variations, introduce  aggregation bias, or possibly both.},

	abstract = {This article examines the extent to which participation in high school  interscholastic sports contributes to male violence. Deriving competing  hypotheses from social control, social learning, and masculinity  theories, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent  Health to test if (1) type of sport and (2) peer athletic participation,  contribute to the risks of male serious fighting. Contrary to social  control expectations, analyses suggest that athletic involvement  fails to inhibit male violence. Moreover, there is a strong relationship  between contact sports and violence. Football players and wrestlers,  as opposed to baseball, basketball, tennis, and other athletes, are  significantly more likely than nonathletic males to be involved in  a serious fight. Additionally, the direct effect of football is explained  by the football participation of individuals' peers. Males whose  friends play football are more likely to fight than other males,  supporting perspectives that emphasize peer contexts as important  mediators. Overall, findings are consistent with the expectations  of social learning and masculinity arguments. The theoretical and  policy implications of these results are discussed.},

These hypotheses emerge  from three theories: constructivism, economic interdependence, and  credible commitments. The authors use a data set of all pairs of  states from 1816 to 1992. Results show that states with similar regime  type are more likely to ally with each other after 1945, although  two democracies are not more likely to ally than two autocracies  during this period, and distance, learning, threat, and common culture  affect alliance behavior, but trade does not. Results indicate sharp  limits to the connection between democracy and international cooperation.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT Currency crises are costly phenomena that have been exceptionally  difficult to explain and predict. We comprehensively examine the  relationship between political institutions and currency crises and  emphasize the causal linkage between institutions, expectations,  and crises. Specifically, we argue that institutional variables&mdash;particularly  divided government and government turnover&mdash;increase the variance  of expectations held by speculators thereby increasing the likelihood  of currency crises. We test these hypotheses using three existing  economic models of currency crises and find that institutional variables  are not only statistically significant, but also substantially improve  the ability of these models to forecast crises.We are grateful to  Helen Milner, Charles Cameron, William Bernhard, and seminar participants  at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California  for helpful comments. Lisa Martin and our referees provided feedback  that helped dramatically improve our arguments and exposition. Andy  Rose, Steve Kamin, Mathieu Bussiere, and Marcel Fratzscher generously  provided data and advice that helped us replicate their findings.

Our vote model captures the swing of  the electoral pendulum between the two major parties while using  prime ministerial approval as the (sole) short-run predictor of vote  choice. The seat model incorporates the inertia of the previous seat  distribution while translating votes into seats. The models forecast  the lead of one major party over the other (percentage for votes  and number for seats). The statistical estimation includes data on  British elections since 1945, although the test for cycles (swing  of the electoral pendulum) goes as far back as 1832. The vote model  picks the winner of every one of the 1945&ndash;2005 elections (out-of-sample  forecasts) and is rarely off by more than 2 percentage points. The  seat model does almost as well, rarely missing the seat lead by more  than 25. },

This article examines two  prominent studies of immediate extended deterrence that do not deal  adequately with the problems inherent in constructing a valid data  set for quantitative analysis. The problems are particularly acute  in the testing of theories of deterrence because of the difficulties  in identifying cases of deterrence success and of inferring the intentions  of would-be challengers. Our analysis explores these problems and  suggests ways of testing theories of deterrence that can reduce the  threats to valid inference.},

	abstract = {Relevant dyads are pairs of contiguous states or pairs of states including  at least one major power. They are argued to be the population of  dyads at risk of international conflict and are increasingly commonly  used as the cases analyzed by conflict researchers. Does reliance  on relevant dyads (a nonrandom sample of all dyads) introduce threats  to valid inference? The authors argue that relevant dyad usage might  introduce related problems of measurement error and selection bias  and investigate whether there is evidence of such potential problems  existing in actual relevant dyad data sets. Results show evidence  for both types of potential problems, but neither problem substantively  affects estimates of conflict relationships. Therefore, relevant  dyad usage is not especially objectionable due to either of these  problems, and retrospective sampling might be an even more profitable  course for future research.},

The resulting model is  estimated using time-series data for a representative state and the  model is used to predict state spending for fiscal year 1985. The  results of the estimation are consistent with the predictions of  the median voter model and the forecasts correspond closely to those  made by the State Bureau of the Budget. In contrast, a naive autoregressive  model of state spending performs poorly.},

I begin with the  implications of loss aversion, the endowment effect, risk orientation,  and framing for theoretical questions relating to the stability of  the status quo in international politics, deterrence, bargaining,  and preventive war. I then raise conceptual and methodological problems  which complicate the theoretical and empirical application of prospect  theory to international behavior. I illustrate my arguments with  references to some recent attempts to use a prospect theory framework  to guide case studies of crises decision-making. I conclude that  in applying prospect theory to empirical cases, the analyst must  demonstrate not only that empirical behavior is consistent with the  theory but also that the observed behavior cannot adequately be explained  by a rational choice model which posits the maximization of expected  value.},

	abstract = {The October 2008 issue of PS published a symposium of presidential  and congressional forecasts made in the summer leading up to the  election. This article is an assessment of the accuracy of their  models.    In summer 2008, our Jobs Model forecast a Democratic presidential  candidate two-party popular vote share of 56.6%, which would deliver  the incumbent party the biggest defeat of any post-World War II contest  (Lewis-Beck and Tien 2008). However, we argued, from our analysis  of different experimental and observational evidence, that this unprecedented  victory would be prevented by racially intolerant voters. We estimated  the net racial cost of being a black candidate and corrected our  overall forecast downward to 50.1% for Barack Obama. The unparalleled  economic crisis, initiated after the release of our summer forecasts,  prompted a reconsideration; the unique shock to the economy was no  ordinary campaign perturbation. We calculated that the ensuing boost  to anti-incumbent economic voting would add approximately two percentage  points to the opposition; therefore, we issued a public revision  of our forecast to 52.0 % for Obama (Lewis-Beck 2008). We are pleased  that this final forecast fell so close to the actual result of 53.5%.  Nevertheless, we contend the actual result should have been much  closer to our original forecast. Given the dismal state of the polity  and the economy prior to the election, the Obama victory should have  been much bigger, as we show below.},

Encouragingly, their  prowess is receiving attention from forecasters outside the social  sciences, in fields such as engineering and commerce. Noteworthy  here is the recent special issue on U.S. presidential election forecasting  published in the International Journal of Forecasting, containing  some 10 different papers (Campbell and Lewis-Beck 2008).

	abstract = {This article examines the relationship between different forms of  cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative  types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The  author builds on Bourdieu's ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the  "forms of capital" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion  dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection between  cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition  to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural  tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he  expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be  converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles  due to its more restricted, "asset-specific" nature. Because of its  generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely  to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly  support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture  on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional  conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear  models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture  consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but  not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption  selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect  on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings  help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different  types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social  positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also  discusses the implications of the results for current models describing  the transformation of cultural into social resources.},

	abstract = {This article is about a simple two-variable equation forecasting presidential  election outcomes and a three-variable equation forecasting seat  change in House elections. Over the past two decades a cottage industry  of political forecasting has developed (Lewis-Beck and Rice 1992;  Campbell and Garand 2000). At the 1994 meeting of the Southern Political  Science Association, several participants offered their forecasts  of the upcoming midterm House elections. Unfortunately, not one of  the forecasters was within 20 seats of the actual outcome. If, however,  these forecasts had been pooled, as Gaddie (1997) points out, then  they would have come remarkably close to the actual seat change that  occurred. Moving forward, at the 1996 APSA Annual Meeting the collection  of forecasters did a much better job with that year's presidential  election. The forecasters also got the overall popular vote outcome  correct at the 2000 APSA Annual Meeting for that year's presidential  election. We all forecasted a victory for Al Gore, with James Campbell  coming the closest to the actual total (50.2%) at 52.8%. At the panel  at the 2004 APSA Annual Meeting almost every forecaster predicted  the actual outcome correctly. Forecasting elections holds us accountable---we  cannot go back and change our forecast for an election after it has  occurred. Moreover, if we stick with one forecast, it easy to judge  the overall accuracy of our equations.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand the interrelations among relations  within concrete social groups. Social structure is sought, not ideal  types, although the latter are relevant to interrelations among relations.  From a detailed social network, patterns of global relations can  be extracted, within which classes of equivalently positioned individuals  are delineated. The global patterns are derived algebraically through  a 'functorial' mapping of the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially  a generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for concatenation  of effects through the network. The notion of functorial mapping  is of central importance in the 'theory of categories,' a branch  of modem algebra with numerous applications to algebra, topology,  logic. The paper contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying  this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Xinyuan Dai (2002) incorrectly  asserts that our conclusion depends on the preferences of the decision  makers who formulate trade policy. We show that Dai fails to accurately  replicate our model, and hence erroneously claims that the new equilibria  she deduces are consistent with it. In addition, we demonstrate that  in altering one of our assumptions, Dai offers a model that is less  realistic as well as inconsistent with the substantive literature  on international bargaining. Finally, we question the robustness  of her approach. Due to these problems of replication, realism, and  robustness, we conclude that Dai's model is of limited utility.},

	abstract = {The concept of international affinity--albeit under different names--captures  a central place in international relations research. This study examines  how different types of affinity affect the likelihood of conflict  between states. The authors discuss different types of affinities  as these appear in the realist and liberal paradigms. They offer  a social networks conception of structural affinity--the concept  of structural equivalence--which reflects the similarity of international  ties across a set of different networks. They test the hypotheses  derived from these paradigms, using both existing measures of affinity  and their own structural equivalence measures. Their findings suggest  that (1) strategic affinity has a consistent dampening effect on  the probability of dyadic conflict, (2) trade-related affinity does  consistently affect the probability of dyadic conflict, and (3) intergovernmental  organization-related affinity has a negative impact on conflict,  mostly in the twentieth century.},

Despite important strengths in their work, we  take issue with three aspects of their research: (1) the substance  of the logit model they compare to their neural network, (2) the  standards they use for assessing forecasts, and (3) the theoretical  and model-building implications of the nonparametric approach represented  by neural networks. We replicate and extend their analysis by estimating  a more complete logit model and comparing it both to a neural network  and to a linear discriminant analysis. Our work reveals that neural  networks do not perform substantially better than either the logit  or the linear discriminant estimators. Given this result, we argue  that more traditional approaches should be relied upon due to their  enhanced ability to test hypotheses. },

	abstract = {Studies of international institutions, organizations, and regimes  have consistently appeared in the pages of International Organization.  We review the theoretical and empirical work on international institutions  and identify promising directions for the institutionalist research  program. Early studies of international institutions were rich with  empirical insights and often influenced by theoretical developments  in other fields of political science, but lacking an overarching  analytical framework they failed to produce a coherent body of scholarship.  Current efforts to reinvigorate the study of international institutions  draw on a new body of theory about domestic institutions. We argue  that the assumptions of this new approach to institutions are more  appropriate to international studies than those of earlier attempts  to transfer theories across levels of analysis. We suggest that the  most productive questions for future research will focus on specifying  alternative mechanisms by which institutions can influence outcomes  and identify particular sets of questions within this agenda that  are especially promising.},

	abstract = {Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in the past  two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey (GSS) collected the  first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom  Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors  replicated those questions to assess social change in core network  structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985.  The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss  important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases  by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004.  The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent  in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were  lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin  ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents,  with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods.  Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them.  Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population.  Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity  has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates,  but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in  America},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous yet inaccurate belief in international relations scholarship  that cognitive biases and emotion cause only mistakes distorts the  field's understanding of the relationship between rationality and  psychology in three ways. If psychology explains only mistakes (or  deviations from rationality), then (1) rationality must be free of  psychology; (2) psychological explanations require rational baselines;  and (3) psychology cannot explain accurate judgments. This view of  the relationship between rationality and psychology is coherent and  logical, but wrong. Although undermining one of these three beliefs  is sufficient to undermine the others, I address each belief-or myth-in  turn. The point is not that psychological models should replace rational  models, but that no single approach has a lock on understanding rationality.  In some important contexts (such as in strategic choice) or when  using certain concepts (such as trust, identity, justice, or reputation),  an explicitly psychological approach to rationality may beat a rationalist  one.},

	abstract = {Poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between cognitive and rational  theories of decision making. PH postulates a two-stage decision process.  During the first stage, the set of possible options is reduced by  applying a "noncompensatory principle" to eliminate any alternative  with an unacceptable return on a critical, typically political, decision  dimension. Once the choice set has been reduced to alternatives that  are acceptable to the decision maker, the process moves to a second  stage, during which the decision maker uses more analytic processing  in an attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits. In this article,  the author applies poliheuristic theory to individual, sequential,  and interactive decision settings. Subsequent articles in this issue  offer theoretical extensions and multiple tests of the theory using  multiple methods (formal, statistical, experimental).},

	abstract = {Economic and organizational sociologists have increasingly demonstrated  that the actions of individuals and firms are affected by the social  networks within which they are embedded. In recent years scholars  have begun to recognize that the effects of these social networks  may vary across populations or types of relations. This article examines  the extent to which the effects of interfirm networks on the behavior  of firms are historically contingent. Focusing on the level of debt  financing among approximately 140 large U.S. corporations over a  22-year period, the authors show that the extent to which the firms'use  of debt was influenced by those with which they were tied through  director interlocks declined over time. The authors argue that this  decline in the network effect reflected a shift in the institutional  environment within which the firms operated, and that it was driven  by three processes: the professionalization of the finance function  within the firm, the internalization of financial decision-making,  and the increased volatility of the environment. They conclude that  corporate financing is socially embedded, but this embeddedness is  historically contingent.},

	abstract = {Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years?  Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage  between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting  that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice.  I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks  and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing  steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship  network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration  network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work  is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However,  structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration  is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent  with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially  integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.},

The  model predicts democratic values to arise from the norms of contract  that are endemic in developed market economies and yields the novel  contingent claim that the peace among democratic nations may be a  pattern limited to those democracies with developed economies. Analyses  of a large number of interstate dyads from 1950 to 1992 show strong  support for this hypothesis. It seems that the pacifying impact of  democracy is about twice as strong among developed countries compared  with other dyads. Among conflict-prone contiguous dyads, the pacifying  impact of democracy does not appear statistically significant among  the poorest decile of joint democratic dyads. The study demonstrates  the wide explanatory power of the simple postulate that social values  and political preferences derive from socioeconomic norms.},

The authors use these results to predict the decline  in friendship segregation that would occur if across- and within-school  residential segregation were eliminated in U.S. metropolitan areas.  The results suggest that about a third of the level of racial friendship  segregation in schools is attributable to residential segregation.  Most of this effect is the result of residential segregation across  schools rather than within them.},

Taking Marra and  Ostrom's (1989) model of congressional elections as representative  of extant theoretical perspectives and testing it against recent  elections, we find that the model fails. We augment Marra and Ostrom's  model with new insights, constructing a model that explains elections  from 1950 to 1998. We find that, although presidential approval ratings  and major political events continue to drive congressional elections,  the distribution of open seats must also be taken into account.},

This article is an assessment of the accuracy of their  models.The Primary Model predicted that Barack Obama would win a  narrow victory with 50.1% of the major-party vote. Obama surpassed  that forecast by just a little more than one standard error (2.5).  How come the model came as close as it did with a forecast issued  as early as January? What prevented it from coming even closer? And  what might be done to improve the model? },

This study draws on the state strength literature to identify relevant  country macrostructural factors that can contribute to different  kinds and levels of intensity of conflict and country instabilities.  A pattern classification algorithm-fuzzy analysis of statistical  evidence (FASE)-is used to analyze the relationships between country  macrostructural factors and historical instances of country instability.  A split-sample validation design is used to evaluate the ability  of FASE to generate competent predictions, using the standard forecasting  performance metrics overall accuracy, recall, and precision. The  results demonstrate the potential for FASE to accurately forecast  not just the occurrence but also the level of intensity of country-specific  instabilities out 5 years with about 80% overall accuracy.},

	abstract = {The birth of a new form of business organization, the partnership  system, in Renaissance Florence is examined closely in order to discover  the social processes of invention in that extraordinarily inventive  place. Stated generally, the processes of invention the authors discover  there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis across multiple  social networks. Specifically, political co-optation of cambio bankers  in the aftermath of the Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of  domestic guild methods to the international plane, thereby changing  their purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption through  marriage of these elevated bankers into the victorious political  alliance infused partnership with the multiplex logic (and often  money) of dowry, thereby reproducing partnership systems as an integral  component in post-Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics  of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance organizational  logics of marriage and clientage. The origins of financial capitalism  are partly rooted in this elite social-network response to class  revolt.},

Cultures may change because they become more  similar to prevailing nearby cultures, are subject to intrinsic random  changes, or expand to previously empty cells. Extending Axelrod's  (1997) results, the authors show that assimilation does not lead  to a single homogeneous culture even if, unlike in Axelrod's model,  cultural assimilation may take place even between neighboring cells  with zero similarity; intrinsic changes decrease rather than increase  the number of stable cultural regions; and expansion of a single  culture in a previously unoccupied territory does not result in a  single culture in the entire territory. Geographical features (such  as mountains) that are an obstacle to contact between cells increase  the number of different cultural regions.},

Crisis  forecasting research itself is best broken down into the forecasting  of levels of conflict, of war and violence, and of crises per se.  After examining each area, the author argues that a great deal of  research has been completed and that the prospects are excellent  for future crisis, forecasting, and crisis forecasting research of  a much more varied and comprehensive nature.},

	abstract = {We analyse the co-evolution of social networks and substance use behaviour  of adolescents and address the problem of separating the effects  of homophily and assimilation. Adolescents who prefer friends with  the same substance-use behaviour exhibit the homophily principle.  Adolescents who adapt their substance use behaviour to match that  of their friends display the assimilation principle. We use the Siena  software to illustrate the co-evolution of friendship networks, smoking,  cannabis use and drinking among sport-active teenagers. Results indicate  strong network selection effects occurring with a preference for  same sex reciprocated relationships in closed networks. Assimilation  occurs among cannabis and alcohol but not tobacco users. Homophily  prevails among tobacco and alcohol users. Cannabis use influences  smoking behavior positively (i.e., increasing cannabis increases  smoking). Weaker effects include drinkers smoking more and cannabis  users drinking more. Homophily and assimilation are not significant  mechanisms with regard to sporting activity for any substance. There  is, however, a significant reduction of sporting activity among smokers.  Also, girls engaged in less sport than boys. Some recommendations  for health promotion programmes are made.},

	abstract = {The polity2 variable from the Polity IV project is the most popular  measure of a country's political regime. This article contends that  the coding rules employed to create a polity2 score during years  of so-called interregnum and affected transitions produce a measure  of democracy that lacks face validity. Using both single and multiple  imputation methods, we construct and evaluate several variables that  offer alternative measures to polity2 during such periods. We recommend  that scholars using polity2 test whether their results are robust  to using our alternatives and using multiple imputation techniques  instead. Where robustness cannot be established, scholars need to  theoretically justify the choice of either polity2 or one of the  alternatives.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, substantial progress has been made toward  a theoretical understanding of why physical integrity abuses are  committed. Unfortunately, these theoretical developments have been  devoid of much practical application. In this article, the authors  explore the feasibility of risk assessment in the study of these  human rights. Borrowing an approach by Gurr and Moore, they construct  a risk assessment vehicle that uses existing models and data to develop  expectations about future increases and decreases in human rights  abuses. Their results indicate that we can isolate a set of cases  that are at a higher risk of experiencing increased human rights  abuse in the following year, as well as those that are ripe for better  protection of human rights. The authors expect these risk and opportunity  assessments to be of interest to students of conflict and peace studies,  as well as to human rights activists and policy makers.},

	abstract = {The rise in the importance of nonstate actors in generating new norms  in world politics has been documented by scholars, but the literature  has focused predominantly on nonsecurity ("new") issue areas. Conversely,  although recent constructivist work in international relations has  examined the security policies of states, typically it is the state  that is doing the constrncting of interests. I bridge these two literatures  by examining the hard case of transnational civil society working  through issue networks to teach state interests in security policy.  I analyze the campaign by transnational civil society to generate  an international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and trace  the effects of several techniques through which states can be said  to be socialized. Through generating issues, networking, "grafting,"  and using a transnational Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof,  the campaign has stimulated systemic normative change through two  processes: norm adoption through the conversion of persuaded moral  entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from social pressures of identity.},

	abstract = {The pacifying effect of economic interdependence on conflict onset  can be better understood in the context of "noisy" bargaining. Specifically,  trading states bargain under less noisy conditions and, as a result,  are unlikely to engage in militarized conflict. Noise is introduced  into a generic take-it-or-leave-it bargaining game in the form of  nonspecific asymmetric information about the defender's reservation  value. Comparative statics show a positive monotonic relationship  between variance in the noise term and the onset of militarized conflict.  The relationships among economic interdependence, variance in the  noise term, and conflict onset are evaluated with a Bayesian heteroskedastic  probit model. Historical data are used to demonstrate that interdependence  and uncertainty are related to each other and jointly related to  the onset of militarized conflict. Uncertainty appears to be reduced  by economic interdependence, and this leads to an enhanced probability  of agreement short of a militarized clash.},

	abstract = {In this article I argue that much of the inconsistency in the scholarly  literature on conflict escalation can be attributed to selection  bias. To control this bias statistically, I use a censored probit  model to evaluate hypotheses about conflict escalation over the time  period of 1950-1985. I report four results. (1) Power parity and  economic development are found to influence conflict nonmonotonically  (2) Although joint democracy and joint satisfaction with the status  quo are found to have robust pacifying effects on the onset of conflict,  the results suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of  disputes to war. (3) Allied pairs of states appear less likely to  escalate their disputes. (4) Finally, the unified model suggests  that it is essential for researchers interested in the escalation  behavior of states to consider first how states become involved in  disputes. Conflict onset and escalation appear to be related processes.},

	abstract = {How do nation-states' political institutions affect the relations  between states? This article addresses that question by testing the  predictions of different theories linking political institutions  to war outcomes. Specifically, rent-seeking and regime legitimacy  theories predict that all democratic belligerents are more likely  to win wars because they fight more effectively. Alternatively, other  theories focusing on the domestic political vulnerability of leaders  and the marketplace of ideas predict that democracies are likely  to be more careful about choosing when to start war. This would mean  that only democratic initiators are more likely to win. Analyzing  all interstate wars from 1816 to 1982 with a multivariate probit  model, we find that democratic initiators are significantly more  likely to win wars; democratic targets are also more likely to win,  though the relationship is not as strong. We also find empirical  support for several control variables, including strategy, terrain,  and capability.},

I use a standard "gravity" model of bilateral merchandise  trade and a large panel data set covering over 50 years and 175 countries.  An extensive search reveals little evidence that countries joining  or belonging to the GATT/WTO have different trade patterns from outsiders,  though the GSP seems to have a strong effect.},

	abstract = {Liberal theorists and, more recently, constructivists have argued  that a shared sense of identity will decrease threat perception and  increase international cooperation. But what processes lead to the  emergence (or collapse) of a shared sense of identity? Drawing on  individual-level experiments of identity change and societal-level  theories of idea diffusion from the constructivist literature, the  authors develop an agent-based computer simulation of identity change.  Four findings emerge from the analysis: (1) there is a curvilinear  relationship between the complexity of agents'views and the emergence  of shared identity, (2) highly unstable environments encourage the  emergence of a shared identity, (3) the presence of leaders (i.e.,  agents with greater influence in the population) in the neighborhood  decreases shared identity, and (4) the interaction of complexity,  stability, and leadership produces extremely polarized societies.},

	abstract = {Social constructivism in international relations has come into its  own during the past decade, not only as a metatheoretical critique  of currently dominant neo-utilitarian approaches (neorealism and  neoliberal institutionalism) but increasingly in the form of detailed  empirical findings and theoretical insights. Constrnctivism addresses  many of the same issues addressed by neo-utilitarianism, though from  a different vantage and, therefore, with different effect. It also  concerns itself with issues that neo-utilitarianism treats by assumption,  discounts, ignores, or simply cannot apprehend within its characteristic  ontology and/or epistemology. The constructivist project has sought  to open up the relatively narrow theoretical confines of conventional  approaches--by pushing them back to problematize the interests and  identities of actors; deeper to incorporate the intersubjective bases  of social action and social order; and into the dimensions of space  and time to establish international structure as contingent practice,  constraining social action but also being (re)created and, therefore,  potentially transformed by it.},

That literature has treated civil war as an aggregate category  and has not considered if identity (ethnic/religious) wars have different  causes than nonidentity wars. The author argues that this is an important  distinction and that identity wars are due predominantly to political  grievance rather than lack of economic opportunity. Ethnic heterogeneity  is also associated differently with identity than nonidentity wars.  Some systemic variables are also important determinants of civil  war, and these have been neglected in the existing literature. An  important new result is that living in a bad neighborhood, with undemocratic  neighbors or neighbors at war, significantly increases a country's  risk of experiencing ethnic civil war.},

@Article{Sandberg2006,
	abstract = {The research presented here addresses a longstanding but previously  unsupported theoretical proposition related to social learning in  the demographic literature. This is that individuals should respond  to lower (higher) infant mortality of socially proximate others with  decreased (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem  directly concerns the translation of the effects of macro-demographic  forces such as mortality into micro-level individual behavior through  social interaction. Using unique data that combine identification  of individuals belonging to women's social networks with direct measurement  of these network members' mortality experience, this research demonstrates  such a linkage. Information concerning the level and variation in  infant mortality available to women from a small Nepalese mountain  population in their social networks is seen to influence the tempo  of their fertility. It is suggested that the methodology employed  has important implications for quantitative analyses of reciprocal  processes of social construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.},

The data consist of  the 1,475 individual confirmation votes from the 1955 nomination  of John Harlan until the 1987-88 nomination of Anthony Kennedy (voice  votes excluded). All of the above factors significantly affect confirmation  voting. The model explains 78% of the variance in senators' decisions,  predicts 92% of the individual votes correctly, and predicts all  of the aggregate outcomes correctly.},

The theoretical model  is a straightforward formalization of the deterrence logic in Huth  (1988) and Huth and Russett (1984), coupled with private information  concerning utilities. Our statistical analysis suggests that the  attacker and defender's decisions are influenced by the balance of  forces, nuclear weapons, defender-protege military alliances, arms  transfers, and trade, as well as the regime types of those involved.  Many of these findings contradict previous research by Huth (1988)  and Huth and Russett (1988). We find that many of the variables involved  in the deterrence calculus are nonmonotonically linked to the probability  of deterrence success or war. We illustrate the results with case  studies of the Soviet-Japanese dispute over Manchukuo (1937-1938)  and the Berlin Blockade (1948).},

@Article{snijders:2006,
	abstract = {The most promising class of statistical models for expressing structural  properties of social networks observed at one moment in time is the  class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p*  models. The strong point of these models is that they can represent  a variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity, that define  complicated dependence patterns not easily modeled by more basic  probability models. Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms  have been developed that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators.  Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed  network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced  back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond  to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence  problems of estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data.  This paper proposes new specifications of exponential random graph  models. These specifications represent structural properties such  as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated  graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three  kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions,  alternating k-triangles, and alternating independent two-paths. Examples  are presented both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the  new specifications lead to much better results than the earlier existing  specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that the new specifications  increase the range and applicability of the ERGM as a tool for the  statistical analysis of social networks.},

	abstract = {The democratic peace has received substantial empirical support in  the modern international system. The consistency of the results does  not imply that reasonable critiques do not exist, that is, the effects  of development, liberal economic structures, and preferences. These  challenges, however, tend to strongly correlate with democracy, making  direct statistical tests inefficient and not necessarily convincing.  This study attempts to evaluate these challenges and extend the temporal  domain of the democratic peace through an empirical analysis of Renaissance  Italy. The data set contains the seven major powers of Renaissance  Italy between 1250 and 1494, with measures of war, power, regime  type, preferences, and contiguity. The analyses show that joint republicanism,  power preponderance, and preference similarity decrease the probability  of war.},

It seeks to answer the question, What regions are  more likely to support more successful secessionist parties? Using  new data in cross-sectional regression analysis, the author finds  that secessionism involves unique factors not common to other kinds  of ethnic conflict. Specifically, in addition to "identity" variables  such as regional language and history of independence, the following  variables explain secessionist strength: lack of irredentist potential,  relative affluence, geographical noncontiguity, population, and multiparty  political system. These factors generally serve as activators of  ethnic identity rather than a substitute for the same, although there  are important cases of nonethnic secessionism.},

Results from a time-series,  cross-sectional regression analysis of data on aggregate policy preferences  from fourteen western democracies (1956-1989) support a hypothesis  originally suggested, for the American case, by Durr (1993): when  the economy expands aggregate policy preferences move left, but when  the economy contracts aggregate policy preferences move right. This  finding sustains the normatively appealing conclusion that change  in aggregate policy preference reflects the measured response of  many individuals to changes in their political environment.},

@Article{Sylvan2004,
	abstract = {This article addresses the issue of how international relations theories  and experts do at forecasting Israeli-Palestinian relations. A group  of academics who study the Middle East were brought together to set  forth their logic and arguments concerning possible future scenarios  of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The article reports on a 'rule-based'  computational model built upon the reasoning of these experts. Sensitivity  analysis of the model is summarized, and four empirical tests of  the model are reported. Relations between Middle East states, externally  generated existential threats to Israel, and domestic structural  factors such as coalition politics in Israel emerge as driving forces  in the sensitivity analysis. Further examination shows that the model  is in theoretical harmony with scholars who have employed two-level  games and has some similarity to realist explanations and frameworks  emphasizing public opinion. Model tests reveal relatively solid results:  comparisons with other forecasts generally favor this model, while  both the cases of the Labor Party coming to power in Israel and a  change in Jordanian behavior after the death of King Hussein lend  further support to the model presented here. Finally, when the scholars  who served as the expert group to produce these forecasts were asked  to reflect back on the process, they exhibited the same rationalizations  that have been found in other expert-based forecasts, even though  the results of the forecasts were more favorable than many such forecasts.},

	abstract = {Secession is an attempt to resolve a domestically based territorial  dispute by dividing a country's homeland territory into new, secessionist  (e.g., Eritrea) and rump (e.g., Ethiopia) states. Yet, the secession  may not have resolved the original dispute to the states' satisfaction.  In the aftermath of a secession, the leader of the rump state is  motivated to use force by the benefits of retaking (some of) the  land lost to the secessionist state, while the secessionist state's  leader is motivated by the benefits of acquiring even more land.  The peaceful versus violent secession process further affects whether  these desires escalate into the use of force. The results--based  on the examination of the consequences of all twentieth-century secessions--reveal  that ethnically based territorial disputes play a much greater role  in conflict onset than do their economically or strategically based  counterparts and that peaceful secessions lead to peaceful relations.},

While the  ability of the realist paradigm to reformulate its theories in light  of criticism accounts for its persistence, it is argued that the  proliferation of emendations exposes a degenerating tendency in the  paradigm's research program. This article applies Lakatos's criterion  that a series of related theories must produce problemshifts that  are progressive rather than degenerating to appraise the adequacy  of realist-based theories on the balancing of power advanced by neotraditionalists.  This research program is seen as degenerating because of (1) the  protean character of its theoretical development, (2) an unwillingness  to specify what constitutes the true theory, which if falsified would  lead to a rejection of the paradigm, (3) a continual adoption of  auxiliary propositions to explain away flaws, and (4) a dearth of  strong research findings.},

The absolute number of Hutu killed in the sample is half of the number  of Tutsi killed. The statistical and econometric results show that  the killing pattern among Hutu and Tutsi was different; Tutsi members  of the same household were often killed on the same day and in the  same place. The effect of the arrival of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF) at the survey sites on the survival chances of Hutu and Tutsi  is estimated.},

Serious  problems exist, however, in their models. For example, they fail  to clearly define "probability" in their models, which creates confusion  regarding how, exactly, predictions are distinct from forecasts.  Also, in their treatment of actual applications of the models, empirical  generalizations are not clearly delineated from definitions and assumptions,  further confusing their arguments. In general, no firm basis is given  in the article to establish a probability value in their models that  is distinct from the unscientific practice of "crystal ball gazing."},

First, his reliance on Imre Lakatos's (1970) model of scientific  progress is problematic, because the Lakatosian model has been largely  rejected by contemporary historians and philosophers of science.  Second, Vasquez understates the range and diversity of the realist  research program and mistakenly sees disagreements among realists  as evidence of theoretical degeneration. Finally, he overlooks the  progressive character of contemporary realist theory, largely because  he does not consider all the relevant literature. Disagreements within  and across competing research programs are essential to progress  and should be welcomed, but Vasquez's effort suggests that criticism  will be most helpful when it seeks to do more than merely delegitimate  a particular research tradition.},

Vasquez claims  that facts observed can falsify a theory by showing that its predictions  are wrong. He fails to consider the puzzles posed by the interdependence  of theory and fact. He places all realists in a single paradigm despite  the divergent assumptions of traditional and structural realists.  In contrast to Vasquez, I argue that explanation, not prediction,  is the ultimate criterion of good theory, that a theory can be validated  only by working back and forth between its implications and an uncertain  state of affairs that we take to be the reality against which theory  is tested, and that the results of tests are always problematic.},

	abstract = {Militarized interstate disputes are widely thought to be less likely  among democratic countries that have high levels of trade and extensive  participation in international organizations. We reexamine this broad  finding of the Kantian peace literature in the context of a model  that incorporates the high degree of dependency among countries.  Based on in-sample statistical tests, as well as out-of-sample, predictive  cross-validation, we find that results frequently cited in the literature  are plagued by overfitting and cannot be characterized as identifying  the underlying structure through which international conflict is  influenced by democracy, trade, and international governmental organizations.  We conclude that much of the statistical association typically reported  in this literature apparently stems from three components: (1) geographical  proximity, (2) dependence among militarized interstate disputes with  the same initiator or target, and (3) the higher-order dependencies  in these dyadic data. Once these are incorporated, covariates associated  with the Kantian peace tripod lose most of their statistical power.  We do find that higher levels of joint democracy are associated with  lower probabilities of militarized interstate dispute involvement.  We find that despite high statistical significance and putative substantive  importance, none of the variables representing the Kantian tripod  is associated with any substantial degree of predictive power.},

The expansion of exports under the RTAA enhanced  political support for increasingly lower U.S. tariffs.

	abstract = {The Rational Design project is impressive on its own terms. However,  it does not address other approaches relevant to the design of international  institutions. To facilitate comparison I survey two "contrast spaces"  around it. The first shares the project's central question-What explains  institutional design?-but addresses alternative explanations of two  types: rival explanations and explanations complementary but deeper  in the causal chain. The second contrast begins with a different  question: What kind of knowledge is needed to design institutions  in the real world? Asking this question reveals epistemological differences  between positive social science and institutional design that can  be traced to different orientations toward time. Making institutions  is about the future and has an intrinsic normative element. Explaining  institutions is about the past and does not necessarily have this  normative dimension. To avoid "driving with the rearview mirror"  we need two additional kinds of knowledge beyond that developed in  this volume, knowledge about institutional effectiveness and knowledge  about what values to pursue. As such, the problem of institutional  design is a fruitful site for developing a broader and more practical  conception of social science that integrates normative and positive  concerns.},

	abstract = {The claim that international institutions can transform state interests  is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that  "process" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally  affect system "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities).  Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered  by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats  interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of  institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations  scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests  of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This  article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism  by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support  of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform  state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies  are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in  processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function  not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution  that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power  for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how  this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty,  by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on mediation as a means for mitigating or at least  minimizing the potentially turbulent and violent consequences of  international crises. Two main research questions are explored: (1)  Does mediation in general affect the dynamics and outcomes of crisis  negotiations? and (2) Does the impact of mediation vary in accordance  with mediator style? Data are drawn from the International Crisis  Behavior data set and from ongoing experimental work with human subjects.  The historical data reveal that mediated crises are more typically  characterized by compromise among crisis actors, are more likely  to end in agreements, and show a tendency toward long-term tension  reduction. The experimental research confirmed the relationship between  mediation and the achievement of agreement and also revealed that  mediation leads to crises of shorter duration and to greater satisfaction  by the parties with the outcome. A manipulative mediation style is  more likely to yield favorable crisis management outcomes than is  a more restrictive facilitative style.},

	abstract = {This article assesses the role of ethnic demographics and domestic  ethnic rebellion in promoting international conflict. Three of the  variables introduced examine dyads within which a common ethnic group  exists. These variables are coded to distinguish the presence of  a trans-border ethnic group that exists as a majority in both states;  a majority in one state and a minority in the other; or a minority  in both states. The pooled dataset, which covers the years 1951-1991,  is analyzed using different types of data to account for both broad  and narrow conceptions of ethnicity. The results indicate a strong  and significant increase in dyadic conflict when two states share  an ethnic group and an ethnic majority exists in at least one of  the states. Ethnic rebellion is also found to significantly harm  interstate relations when an ethnic diaspora is involved. Associations  found between ethnicity and international conflict are most pronounced  when international disputes involve fatalities.},

In authoritarian regimes more dependent on domestic investment than  natural resource revenue, the dictator creates a binding legislature  as a credible constraint on the regime's confiscatory behavior. In  regimes dependent on natural resource revenue, the nonbinding legislature  serves as a mechanism for the dictator to bribe and split the opposition  when he faces credible challenges to the regime. Using data from  121 authoritarian regimes from 1950 to 2002, the results indicate  that binding legislatures have a positive impact on economic growth  and domestic investment, while nonbinding legislatures have a negative  impact on economic growth.},

	abstract = {In 1973 Granovetter formulated the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis  (SWT), which became the foundation of a vast sociological literature  on social networks in labor markets. Until now, SWT has never been  directly tested but treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship  between an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as characteristics  of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT as a proposition about  the probability of getting a job as a function of within-actor differences  in tie strength and tests it with data on hires carried out in one  Russian city in 1998. In support of SWT, the results show that a  worker is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties rather  than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in their abilities  to provide timely access to non-redundant information and to influence  employers directly. In contrast, strong ties are associated with  indirect influence on employers through well-connected intermediaries.  The estimates come from a within-worker fixed-effect conditional  logistic regression and thereby provide rare evidence of an association  between information and influence transferred through social ties  and labor market outcomes, independent of workers' individual characteristics.},

	abstract = {To model, from its inception, interenterprise network formation and  its interaction with foreign investment across an entire epoch of  rapid and profound economic transformation, the authors gathered  data on the complete ownership histories of 1,696 of the largest  Hungarian enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social sequence  analysis to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network  resources to buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain  knowledge and legitimacy. During this period, networked property  grew, stabilized, and involved a growing proportion of foreign capital.  Cohesive networks of recombinant property were robust, and in fact  integrated foreign investment. Although multinationals, through their  subsidiaries, dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors  find evidence that they also built durable networks. These findings  suggest that developing economies do not necessarily face a forced  choice between networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.},
